Documentation\+: Documentation done by doxygen and link has been provided to the graders and teacher.

Execution\+: To run this program run ./load\+Bal and then enter the number of cloack cycles you\textquotesingle{}d like the load balancer to run and then the number of servers you\textquotesingle{}d like to have. Program will then run and create the log file.
