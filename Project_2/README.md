# This is CSCE 412 Project 2: Load Balancer

## Goal: 
The goal of this project is to create a load balancer simulator. 
After executing a log file will be generated that has a log of when
a request was completed by what server and how many requests are left
after run time.

## Documentation: 
Documentation for this project is provided by Doxygen.
To see each class and its functions please check the classes tab.

## Execution: 
To run this program run ./loadBal and then enter the
number of cloack cycles you'd like the load balancer to run and then
the number of servers you'd like to have. Program will then run and
create the log file.
